# Random Programming Questions (RPQs)

## Purpose

I am creating this section just for some random programming questions I feel like solving.

For example, this was my first attempt at a RPQ: https://github.com/shanegrayson/coding_examples/blob/master/CPPPlayground/RPQs/FizzBuzz

I came across this statment in an article I read (http://web.archive.org/web/20161003201657/https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/) which one of the interviewees stated:


>After a fair bit of trial and error I've discovered that people who struggle to code don't just struggle on big problems, or even smallish problems (i.e. write a implementation of a linked list). They struggle with tiny problems. 

>So I set out to develop questions that can identify this kind of developer and came up with a class of questions I call "FizzBuzz Questions" named after a game children often play (or are made to play) in schools in the UK. An example of a Fizz-Buzz question is the following:

>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

>Most good programmers should be able to write out on paper a program which does this in a under a couple of minutes. Want to know something scary? The majority of comp sci graduates can't. I've also seen self-proclaimed senior programmers take more than 10-15 minutes to write a solution.

Thankfully, I was able to write the iterative method (for loop) in less than 10 minuites, but I did spend another 30 minutes trying to figure out a recurssive solution.
