# coding_examples
This is my personal repository for small programs I have coded.

RubyPlayground is where I took a tutorial on the Ruby programming language. Many of the files were examples or exercises from the book.

Inside of https://github.com/shanegrayson/coding_examples/tree/master/RubyPlayground/FFXIV_BiS_Solver is a program I'm working on as a side project that solves equipment issues in the Online Game Final Fantasy XIV.

Inside of https://github.com/shanegrayson/coding_examples/tree/master/CPlayground is my attempt at working through the book "The C Programming Language" by K&R. A few of the final questions I needed to take from the answer book.
