# coding_examples
This is my personal repository for small programs I have coded or exercises I have been working on.

## C++
Inside of https://github.com/shanegrayson/coding_examples/tree/master/CPPPlayground is my attempt at working through the "C++ Primer Plus" book by Stephen Prata. My goal will be to attempt all the exercises in the book without any outside of help.

*UPDATE*: I am currently working through this book. As of 01/06/2020 I have made it to Chapter 10, this is 500+ pages in. It is a very thorough look into C++11 and I am enjoying it very much. Sadly, After I am finished with Chapters 10 and 11, I will be starting up a Ruby on Rails Book, seeing as this is the favored language the Co-Owners of my business would prefer to work in. 

## C
Inside of https://github.com/shanegrayson/coding_examples/tree/master/CPlayground is my attempt at working through the book "The C Programming Language" by K&R. A few of the final questions I needed to take from the answer book.I only plan on going so far to have a bit move familiarity of C before moving onto the C++ Primer Plus book below.

*NOTE*: I stopped working through this book because I started struggling with uderstanding the book in general. Many of the problems were being built on previous examples, one inparticular which I skipped because a global variable the book mentioned to use for a stack was not updating. Plus, I was just more excited to start the C++ Primer Plus book.

## Ruby
RubyPlayground is where I took a tutorial on the Ruby programming language. Many of the files were examples or exercises from the book.

Inside of https://github.com/shanegrayson/coding_examples/tree/master/RubyPlayground/FFXIV_BiS_Solver is a program I'm working on as a side project that solves equipment issues in the Online Game Final Fantasy XIV.
