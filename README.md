# coding_examples
This is my personal repository for small programs I have coded or exercises I have been working on.

## C++
Inside of https://github.com/shanegrayson/coding_examples/tree/master/CPPPlayground is my attempt at working through the "C++ Primer Plus" book by Stephen Prata. My goal will be to attempt all the exercises in the book without any outside of help.


## C
Inside of https://github.com/shanegrayson/coding_examples/tree/master/CPlayground is my attempt at working through the book "The C Programming Language" by K&R. A few of the final questions I needed to take from the answer book.I only plan on going so far to have a bit move familiarity of C before moving onto the C++ Primer Plus book below.

## Ruby
RubyPlayground is where I took a tutorial on the Ruby programming language. Many of the files were examples or exercises from the book.

Inside of https://github.com/shanegrayson/coding_examples/tree/master/RubyPlayground/FFXIV_BiS_Solver is a program I'm working on as a side project that solves equipment issues in the Online Game Final Fantasy XIV.


## Python
Once I am finished with the C++ Primer Plus Book, I am going to begin the Python book.
