# Chapter 3: Questions and Answers
Answer to review questions from C++ Primer Plus

**MA** -> My Answers without refering to the back of the book for an answer.

**BA** -> Book's answer to the review question.

## Question 1: 
Why does C++ have more than one integer type?

**MA**:

I am making the assumption that the books is talking about signed and unsigned values and possibly how integers can be different on different machiens (such as 16 bits on one system and 32 bits on another).

C++ has more than one integer type to represent values. They differ in amount of meemory used and whether or not the value is signed or unsigned. The value sizes are usually followed:

-short: 16 bits. (2 bytes)
-int: at least as bit as short. (4 bytes)
-long: int is at least 32 bits. (4 bytes)
-long long: int is at least 64 bits. (8 bytes)

**BA**: 

Having more than one integer type let's you choose the typethat is best suited to a particular need. For example, you could use short to conserve space or long to guarentee storage capacity or to find that a particular type speeds up a particular calculation.
