## Question 2: 
Does Chapter Review question 1 use the array templet class instead of the built-in C arrays?

**MA**:

No, id doesnt use the array templet class. If so, it would state that it is calling the array header file and how to initalize the arrays would be something similar like:

1. array<char, 30> actors;
