# C++ Programming Playground

## CPPPP_Book

The C++ Primer Plus book is the current text I am working through to keep my programming skills relavent, and because when I was attending school. I was struggling a lot with the concepts of the class, and now, after completing Uni, and I would like to revist this language now that I have a deeper understanding fo programming and Computer Science.

## leet_code_problems

This section of my GitHub is dedicated to solving some of Leet Codes C++ problems. Just as I am doing with the book, I plan on not view or seeing any solutions until I have my own working solution. I do have some rules to help guide my way:

1. If I full complete a challange and my code work,
2. If I am stuck on a problem longer than 48 hours,
3. I will only attempt problems have worked through solutions, for example, I have just finished https://github.com/shanegrayson/coding_examples/blob/master/CPPPlayground/leet_code_problems/242/242.cpp which is a simple anagram problem, and a worked through solution can be found at this YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ns7UFp1o54&t=15s.
